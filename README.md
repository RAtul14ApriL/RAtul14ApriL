### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Ratul
I am a Full Stack Developer. I have graduated from Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp in February 2022. I have gained hands-on experience on Javascript, React, Node/Express, PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, SASS and jQuery. I have also gained experience in testing tools like Cypress, Jest, Mocha and Chai. I have developed several apps namely, Hire/:D (online portfolio app), Interview Scheduler, Jungle (e-commerce app), TechMarket (online buy-sell marketplace), TinyApp (URL shortener app), etc. Currently I am looking for an entry-level developer position.
